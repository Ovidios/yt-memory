# ![](icons/ytm-32.png) YT Memory

*A Firefox add-on to help find YouTube recommendations you accidentally clicked away from.*

## About
YT Memory keeps a log of the last 100 YouTube videos you've been recommended, in case you accidentally click away.

I often see an interesting video thumbnail on my YouTube home page just after I've already clicked on another one. Then, when I go back, the video's gone. Sometimes I'll have luck refreshing the page, but sometimes I don't and the video is lost forever...

This is a simple add-on to keep a list of the last 100 videos shown in the recommendations on YouTube!

I wrote this just to solve this problem for myself (and I'd never written an add-on for a browser before) so this is probably not the best solution! Feel free to try it anyway!
